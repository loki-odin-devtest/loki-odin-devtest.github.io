    <h1><strong>VOCAL MUSIC LESSONS . . . </strong></h1>
    <h2><strong>A LIFETIME OF JOY</strong></h2>
    <p>Congratulations on choosing to participate in music lessons. Music has been found to enrich the lives of all who
        participate in its creations or in its enjoyment. When you choose to take vocal music lessons you are choosing
        to
        learn a skill that will benefit you and bring you joy your entire life! No price can be put on such a beautiful
        art
        as music, in any form. Yet, obtaining the skill will certainly require assistance from a professional—your music
        teacher . . . Me.</p>
    <p>I have chosen to make music my occupation. As with any business, costs are calculated to both ensure that the
        highest
        quality product is given and that my business makes enough to continue providing my services and expertise.</p>

    <p class="heading"><strong>What does my yearly tuition cover?</strong></p>

        <li class="heading"><strong>Time spent in preparation for the student</strong></li>
    </ul>

        by professional music journals that to every hour enrolled in music lessons, you are investing in up to 2 hours of the teacher’s
        time</p>
